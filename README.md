# Angelia

Angelia is an intentional family connection app designed to solve "conversational overload." It moves away from the noise of group chats and toward organized, private family communication.

## Features

### 🔥 Landing Page

A minimalist, high-impact landing page that introduces Angelia's core value proposition:

- **Brand Identity**: Warm logo featuring a house with heart, representing family connection
- **Hero Section**: "Family Connection, Without the Noise." with prominent "Get Started" call-to-action
- **Categorical Agency**: Highlights the bilateral agency model where sharers categorize updates and readers subscribe to what matters, with visual illustration
- **Target Use Cases**: 
  - 🏡 **Long-Distance Families** - Anchor yourself in the family narrative
  - 💼 **Busy Professionals** - Catch up on themed updates during downtime
  - 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **The Saturated Parent** - Share unfiltered updates without performance pressure

### 📖 About Page - The Manifesto

A text-focused page explaining the research and philosophy behind Angelia:

- **Consumer-Friendly Content**: Warm, human language that avoids jargon and speaks directly to real people
- **The Connectivity Paradox**: Explores how more communication channels lead to less meaningful connection
- **Three Core Sections**:
  - **The Crisis of Synchronous Noise** - Why group chats and social media fail to deliver meaningful family connection
  - **The Solution: Angelia** - How channel-based organization and subscription agency solve conversational overload
  - **The 180-Day Rule** - Why updates fade after six months to mirror human memory and reduce performance pressure
- **Comparison Table**: Visual comparison of Privacy, Intentionality, and Ephemerality between traditional social media and Angelia

### 🎨 Design & Visual Aesthetic

- **Warm, Domestic Accent Color**: Amber tones create an intentional, calm atmosphere (not high-engagement)

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Typography**: Large, readable headings with ample whitespace for clarity
