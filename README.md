# Angelia

Angelia is an intentional family connection app designed to solve "conversational overload." It moves away from the noise of group chats and toward a shared "Digital Hearth."

## Features

### 🔥 Landing Page (The Digital Hearth)

A minimalist, high-impact landing page that introduces Angelia's core value proposition:

- **Hero Section**: "Family Connection, Without the Noise." with prominent "Enter the Hearth" call-to-action
- **Categorical Agency**: Highlights the bilateral agency model where sharers categorize updates and readers subscribe to what matters
- **Target Use Cases**: 
  - 🏡 **Long-Distance Families** - Anchor yourself in the family narrative
  - 💼 **Busy Professionals** - Catch up on themed updates during downtime
  - 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **The Saturated Parent** - Share unfiltered updates without performance pressure

### 🎨 Design & Visual Aesthetic

- **Warm, Domestic Accent Color**: Amber tones create an intentional, calm atmosphere (not high-engagement)
- **Minimalist Layout**: Clean, spacious design using standard layout structures
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Typography**: Large, readable headings with ample whitespace for clarity
