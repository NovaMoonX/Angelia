# Angelia

Angelia is an intentional family connection app designed to solve "conversational overload." It moves away from the noise of group chats and toward organized, private family communication.

## Features

### 🔥 Landing Page

A minimalist, high-impact landing page that introduces Angelia's core value proposition:

- **Brand Identity**: Warm logo featuring a house with heart, representing family connection
- **Hero Section**: "Family Connection, Without the Noise." with prominent "Get Started" call-to-action
- **Categorical Agency**: Highlights the bilateral agency model where sharers categorize updates and readers subscribe to what matters, with visual illustration
- **Target Use Cases**: 
  - 🏡 **Long-Distance Families** - Anchor yourself in the family narrative
  - 💼 **Busy Professionals** - Catch up on themed updates during downtime
  - 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **The Saturated Parent** - Share unfiltered updates without performance pressure

### 📰 Primary Feed (Tidings)

A chronological feed for family updates called "Tidings":

- **Dynamic Post Cards**: Each tiding features:
  - Author avatar with preset cartoon-like icons
  - Channel badge with color coding
  - Rich text content
  - Media area supporting single images or image carousels for multiple photos
  - Relative timestamps (e.g., "30m ago", "2h ago")
- **Filtering**: Select dropdown to filter tidings by channel (All Channels or specific subscriptions)
- **Sorting**: Choose between "Newest First" or "Oldest First" ordering
- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatically loads more tidings as you scroll down
- **Loading States**: Skeleton cards provide visual feedback while loading
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no tidings match filters

### 🎨 Design & Visual Aesthetic

- **Warm, Domestic Accent Color**: Amber tones create an intentional, calm atmosphere (not high-engagement)
- **Minimalist Layout**: Clean, spacious design using standard layout structures
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Typography**: Large, readable headings with ample whitespace for clarity
